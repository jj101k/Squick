WHAT THIS IS
------------

This is a library of general Javascript (DOM) helpers.

RATIONALE
---------

Put simply, it's not jQuery.

DOM is, as you quickly find out if you try to use it, distinctly
awkward to handle for the common cases. There are a number of
libraries which aim to resolve this (a popular one being jQuery),
but they have their own disadvantages, and I want to use something
better. Disadvantages you might see include:

- Poor documentation
- Completely unclear API <-> DOM mapping, hindering use of existing
  knowledge.
- Unclear API <-> Javascript mapping, making it difficult to use
  normal Javascript code with the API (eg. all objects implicitly
  being collections of obects)
- Unnecessary reimplementation of built-in language features, largely
  for extreme backward compatibility
- Syntax which encourages poor programming (specifically jQuery
  encourages you to scrape the node tree all the time rather than
  keep track of the nodes you've already seen).

The advantages that such frameworks (for example the backwards
compatibility) do have tend to keep you tied to the disadvantages.

Squick is intended to very simply provide the primary advantages
of a DOM helper library without the mess, while retaining compatibility
with reasonably modern browsers, with the extreme of intended
compatibility at time of writing being MSIE8.
